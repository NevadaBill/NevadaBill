- 👋 Hi, I’m @NevadaBill
- 👀 I’m interested in creating original code for Anki.  In a broader sense, in creating instructional videos for the sanme app to expand accessibility, understanding, versatility and ease of use and make the code avalible to users.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others similarly interested, that is to the extent I'm able.
- 📫 I may be reached at NevadaBill@protonmail.com
